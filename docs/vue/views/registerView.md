"RegisterView" - single-file component that defines a registration form for a user. The form contains three input fields for the user's login, password, and email, and a "Register" button. When the user submits the form, the server sends a POST request to a local endpoint /register to register the user. If the registration is successful, the user is redirected to the home page after a two-second delay. Otherwise, an alert is displayed on the screen.

Methods:
- validPassword(): This method is used to validate the user's password. It checks if the password is at least six characters long and contains at least one special character. It returns a boolean value.

- register(): This method is called when the user submits the registration form. It first checks if the user's password is valid using the validPassword() method. If the password is valid, it sends a POST request to the server's /register endpoint with the user's login, password, and email. If the server responds with a 200 status code, it displays a success message and sets two cookies: user-login-flag and user-login. It then redirects the user to the home page after a two-second delay. If the server responds with a 401 status code, it displays a warning message that the user already exists. If the password is invalid, it displays a warning message that the password must be at least six characters long and contain at least one special character.
